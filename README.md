# A-Markov-Distinction

A coding project that uses a Markov Chain to generate visual art

System: Markov Monet

This system is personally meaningful to me because the input picture I chose was of my favorite painting in the Musee de l'Orangerie in Paris.
I am a big fan of Monet's Water Lillies and the colors in this specific piece (Morning With Willows) are absolutely stunning in person. 
The reason that my system works the way it does is that each of Monet's Water Lillies (more than 250 paintings) is unique in terms of color pallettes, scale, scenery,
and that they were inspired by major life events, one specifically being the death of his wife. I chose to imitate his uniquness in my system, by randomly choosing pixels and 
giving each unique pixel the same probability to appear (over 54,000 to be exact) to create a new image. 

This project challenged me as a computer scientist as I had never written a program from start to finish. The hardest part was being able to conceptualize how I wanted
my system to run, and then turning that into code. This was an important challenge for me as I have much to learn about creating projects, as well as the many different ways to 
make a computer execute your desired commands. Going forward, I will make sure that (when I am allowed to) consult with my peers about their projects because I was very much lostwhen I started this project, and I think it would have been interesting to consider other approaches to the task as well.

I believe that my system is creative because it is meaningful to me, and it produced an output that I was proud of (whether or not it truly looks creative to others).
